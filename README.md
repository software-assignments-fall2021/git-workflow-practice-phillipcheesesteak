[MongoDB surge wraps up a massive week for open-source software as a business](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/mongodb-tops-30-billion-market-cap-in-banner-week-for-open-source.html)

### Interesting Parts

<p>MongoDB is not an exception to the breakneck speed technology stocks gained value within the stock market during the pandemic. On year-to-year basis, MongoDB gained 102.51% in value. This means that MongoDB has a market cap that went past $32 billion, making it the most valuable open-sourced company. </p>

<p>MongoDB is also following the trend of building things in the clouds. In MongoDB's case, more specifically, its main product is a database made to store things in the clouds, with also an offering of a rapidly growing cloud service, which produces higher revenue than its main product. MongoDB is projected to earn $800 million for the fiscal year. </p?>

### Personal thoughts

<p>While it is a great news for the cutting-edge technology advocates that it, along with all the other technology companies such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, and FaceBook, has been receiving much love from investors the past few years, many older investors are wary because of the similarities to the dotcom bubble, where people were in a frenzy to purchase any tech companies without caring about the fundamentals. This eventually led to a bubble, which its burst wiped hundreds of billions of dollars from the market. This led to decades of caution og blue-chip stocks, which has once again been having an all-time high confidence by investors.</p>

### Medha's thoughts
<p>As someone who's used MongoDB in the past and realized how effective and useful of a resource it is when doing things as simple as creating a username and password on a full stack aplication, I think the fact that MongoDB's tech stocks is reflective of the positive future of framework and database technology. While I do think it is possible that as you said it could lead a bubble and severely hurt investors and the economy in the end because people are just buying tech stocks in a frenzy, I think MongDB is a responsible tech stock purchase. However, I do hope that since we're now well aware that these kinds of repercussions are possible both buyers and stock market regulators will make an effort to take preventative measures.</p>
